# NBA Data Analysis
Project to explore the progression of a stat of a NBA game. In this project, we take the user input for a list of games and a stat that you want to visualize. For each game, we take as an input a home_team, an away_team and a line to set as a threshold.

The last part of the project is about giving information about the teams of a given game. First, we display all of the last n games for the team, printing the wins in green and the losses in red. After that, we print the % of those games that the team was above the selected line for that stat. We do that both in a general context and in a home/away context.

Finally, we plot a chart that shows the progression of totals for that stat, setting a vertical line that represents the threshold set earlier.
